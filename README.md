# distractino
A web browser extension that can auto-skip ads and aims to make your YouTube consumption a bit more intentional. Say no to distractions.

Your YouTube home page can be a great place to find helpful videos that reflect your watch history, but it can also be a breeding ground for distracting videos that chip away at your focus and will power. Your curiosity gets the better of you, you click on one video and that dreaded recommended section suddenly pulls you into a deep rabbit hole you never thought you'd get yourself into.

distracti**no** helps you fight these distractions and make your time on, what is otherwise a great platform to learn something new and develop any of your skills, more intentional. Oh and of course, that includes all those pesky ads :). This is no ad blocker but it will reduce your video ad wait time to 0 seconds, so you'll never have to actually sit through unskippable ads or wait 5 seconds just to get back to that super important video you were so intensely focused on (or not).
